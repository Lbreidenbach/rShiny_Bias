# McBias Shiny Web Application
This is the [McBias](https://github.com/Lbreidenbach/McBias) R package with a Shiny UI to use it in browser.

## Setup
All dependencies can be installed with `install.R`. There is a Dockerfile present that allows building a docker container based on the [Rocker project docker images](https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/shiny.html), which can be independently deployed.

The application can also be hosted on https://www.shinyapps.io/ using their tooling. It should be possible to deploy as-is.
